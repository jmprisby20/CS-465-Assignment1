# CS 465/665 Project 1 
# Infomation Retrieval System

To run the script do the following steps
1. Install python ( we used version 3.11.2 )
2. Install Prereq packages 
    * pip install nltk
    * pip install contractions
    * pip install regex
    * Alternatively there is the requirements file so you could do: pip install -r requirements ( Have to be in directory with the file )
    * If you run into issues I included another file in the misc folder which contains all of the python packages installed on my person machine which can be run the same way as the requirements.txt
3. To run the program just do: python CS465-W24-IRproject-Group2-main.py ( in folder containing the file )

The program will automatically process files from the docs folder, the intended format is txt files.

NOTE: Contractions has been removed

Additional NOTES:
* Tbe binary query requires you input text in both fields.
